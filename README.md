# Computer Vision Traffic Counter

This project is a computer vision-based traffic counter that uses image processing techniques to analyze video footage and count the number of vehicles passing through a specified area. It can be used for various applications such as traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, and traffic flow optimization.

## Model and Training

The base model used was the YOLOv8 model by [ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). Further training was done using the [visDrone](https://github.com/VisDrone/VisDrone-Dataset) dataset to focus on identifying objects from a high view point such as from a traffic camera.

## Possible Application

The computer vision traffic counter project has various potential applications, including:

- Traffic monitoring: The system can be used to monitor and analyze traffic patterns in real-time, providing valuable insights for traffic management and planning.
- Congestion analysis: By counting the number of vehicles passing through a specific area, the project can help identify congested areas and optimize traffic flow.
- Traffic flow optimization: The data collected by the traffic counter can be used to optimize traffic signal timings and improve overall traffic efficiency.
